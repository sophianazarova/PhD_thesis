Linear growth of Macoma balthica (North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans).

The growth of bivalve Macoma balthica was investigated in 7 tidal areas at the Murmansk coast in the Barents Sea: cape Abram, bays Pala, Gavrilovo, Yarnyshnaya, Dalne-Zeleneckaya, Shelpino, Porchnikha. The growth rate of M.balthica was determined by reading of annual growth ring on shell. 

Also we use literature data about the same parametres from Atlantic coast of the North America: Rand Harbor (Massachusets) (Gilbert, 1974), Hudsons Bay (Manitoba) (Green, from Gilbert, 1974), Cobscook Bay (Maine) (Commito, 1982), Winsdor (Bay of Fundy) (Turk et al., 1980), St.Laurence River (Quebek) (Lavoie, 1960; Vincent et al.,1989); and from Atlantic coast of Europe: H75 (Baltic Sea) (Venne & Klusek, 1985), Tvarminne area (Baltic Sea)(Vogel, 1959), Finland Gulf (Baltic Sea) (Segerstrale, 1960), Tvaren Bay (Baltic Sea) (Bergh, 1974), Le Verdon and Phare de Richard (Gironde Estuary) (Bachelet, 1980), North Sea (Vogel, 1959), Klushiha bay and strait Sukhaya salma (White sea) (Maximovich et al., 1992), Ermolinskaya Bay (White Sea) (Semenova, 1970). 

The growth of M.balthica shell is described by von Bertalanffy equation. The comparison of growth curves was done by analyzing the residual dispersion (Allen, 1976). The ratio F/Fcrit (at significance level a < 0.05) was used as an index of distance in dendrogram according to Maximovich, 1989. This was due to the fact that Fcr itself cannot be used because of the necessity to determine its value repeatedly according to degrees of freedom. As a result, all values of the index F/Fcrit < 1 show that (at a = 0.05) the differences between compared age curves are random (Maximovich, 1989).

9 group of M. balthica with different growth was observed. Shells with the highest and the lowest growth rates was finded in singular areas: Rand Harbor (23.1 mm in 6 years) and Ermolinskaya Bay (15.5 mm in 30 years) respectively. In Ermolinskaya Bay the longest lifespan (30 years) of M. balthica was was observed.

Other 6 group was consist of shells from a few areas and their growth rate was intermediate. There are neither lalitudinal nor longitudinal patterns in shells groups. This result contradict J. J. Beukema and B.W. Meehan (1985) data about correlation between latitude and M. balthica growth rate.
If there are data from different tidal zone level they grouped in one cluster. It means that local factors determine M. balthica growth more than climat factors. Probably this local factor is trophic conditions.

#from Yuta

	The growth of bivalve Macoma balthica was studied in 7 tidal sites at the Murmansk coast of the Barents Sea: cape Abram, bays Pala, Gavrilovo, Yarnyshnaya, Dalne-Zeleneckaya, Shelpino, Porchnikha. The growth rate of M.balthica was determined by the width of annual growth ring of the shells.
	We also used measurements of the same parametr from Atlantic coast of the North America: Rand Harbor (Massachusets) (Gilbert, 1974), Hudsons Bay (Manitoba) (Green, from Gilbert, 1974), Cobscook Bay (Maine) (Commito, 1982), Winsdor (Bay of Fundy) (Turk et al., 1980), St.Laurence River (Quebek) (Lavoie, 1960; Vincent et al.,1989); and from Atlantic coast of Europe: H75 (Baltic Sea) (Venne & Klusek, 1985), Tvarminne area (Baltic Sea) (Vogel, 1959), Finland Gulf (Baltic Sea) (Segerstrale, 1960), Tvaren Bay (Baltic Sea) (Bergh, 1974), Le Verdon and Phare de Richard (Gironde Estuary) (Bachelet, 1980), North Sea (Vogel, 1959), Klushiha bay and strait Sukhaya salma (White sea) (Maximovich et al., 1992), Ermolinskaya Bay (White Sea) (Semenova, 1970).
	The growth of M.balthica shell is described by von Bertalanffy equation. The comparison of growth curves was done by analyzing the residual dispersion (Allen, 1976). We adopted F/Fcrit ratio (significance level a < 0.05) as an index of distance after Maximovich (1989). Values of F/Fcr < 1 (a = 0.05) indicate that differences between compared age curves are random.
	9 groups of M. balthica with different patterns of growth were identified. The highest growth rate was recorded for Rand Harbor (23.1 mm in 6 years) and the least for Ermolinskaya Bay (15.5 mm in 30 years). At Ermolinskaya Bay we also observed the longest lifespan of M. balthica (30 years).
	Shells comprising every other group were found in several locations. We found no latitudinal or longitudinal patterns in their distribution. These results are in contradiction with J. J. Beukema and B.W. Meehan (1985) data. The latter authors proped positive/negative (тебе лучше знать какую) correlation between latitude and M. balthica growth rate.
	Contrary to expectations, exposure time during the tide cycle does not affect the growth rate of M.balthica. Factor (or factors) acting at the local level are of more importance to its growth, than climate. One may speculate that such local factors are feeding conditions.
