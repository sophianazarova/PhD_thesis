  abstract = {Recruitment of Cerastoderma edule (L.), Mya arenaria L., Mytilus edulis
	L., and Macoma balthi-
		ca (L.) on an intertidal flat in the Danish Wadden Sea was very successful
	in a year following a severe winter.
		Initially, densities of Cerastoderma edule up to 60000 ind’m-s were
	observed but shortly after settling
		declining densities occurred. Among the main epibenthic predators
	on juvenile animals on the flat, small
		individuals of the shore crab, Carcinus maenas (L.) were found to
	be important. Thus, laboratory experi-
		ments demonstrated that juvenile crabs in particular were preying
	on Cerastoderma edule. The juvenile crabs
		arrived simultaneously with the spat of C. edule. In July and August,
	the production of juvenile crabs was
		estimated to account for 26.1% of the elimination of cockles. Later
	the cockles were protected from
		predation by crabs by size. Analysis of stomach contents showed that
	another dominating predator on the
		flat, Crangon crangon (L.), was mainly feeding on meiofauna. We suggest
	that the juvenile individuals of
		Carcinus maenas play a key role in structuring the benthic community
	in the Wadden Sea by preventing the
		development of cockle beds.},
