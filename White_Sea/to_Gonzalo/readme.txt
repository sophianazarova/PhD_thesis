DATA
area		sampling sites: Estuary, Goreliy, Lomnishniy, YuG, ZRS
tidal_zone	tidal level where cores were sampled: high, middle, low, hydrographicum_datum
year		years of sampling
N.1year		mean abundance (indd.*m-2) of Macoma in 1+ age (Ages were reconstructed with measuring of shell length and counting of winter growth stop rings, that I make in 2013 materials)
N.8mm		mean abundance (indd.*m-2) of Macoma with shell length >8 mm. In the White Sea it is the length of sexual maturity for Macoma (Semenova,1980; Maximovich, 1985)
N.elder1y	mean abundance (indd.*m-2) of Macoma in age > 1+
N.1mm		mean abundance (indd.*m-2) of Macoma with shell length >=1 mm (at some sites there were used sieves 0.5 mm, at other - 1 mm, therefore we use only molluscs with shell length >=1 mm)
